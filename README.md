<h1>Rock Paper Scissor Game in Kotlin</h1>

A basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Kotlin. This project helped me practice Kotlin basics and conditional logic.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<h3>Install Kotlin:</h3>Make sure you have Kotlin installed on your machine. You can download it from Kotlin's official website.
<h3>Set up an IDE:</h3> If you're not using a command-line interface, it's recommended to use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio for easier development.
<h3>Create a Kotlin file:</h3> In your IDE, create a new Kotlin file (e.g., Main.kt)
<h3>Copy the Code:</h3>Paste the Rock-Paper-Scissors game code into your Kotlin file.
<h3>Run the Program:</h3>Click on the "Run" button in your IDE or use the command line to execute the Kotlin file using:

<h2>Features:</h2>
<h3>Random Computer Move:</h3> The game generates a random choice for the computer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
<h3>User Input:</h3>The user can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
<h3>Winner Determination:</h3> The game compares the userâ€™s input with the computer's move and determines the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
<h3>Display Results:</h3> The game prints the computer's move, the user's move, and announces the winner.

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
<h3>GUI Version:</h3> Convert the game into a graphical user interface (GUI) version using JavaFX or Kotlin's libraries, so players can interact with buttons instead of the console.
<h3>Score Tracking:</h3> Implement a feature that keeps track of the score throughout multiple rounds, so players can see their cumulative wins, losses, and ties.
<h3>Play Again Option:</h3> After each round, prompt the player if they want to play again, instead of exiting the program.
