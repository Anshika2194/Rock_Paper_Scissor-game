Rock Paper Scissor Game in Kotlin

A basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Kotlin. This project helped me practice Kotlin basics and conditional logic.

How to Run:
Install Kotlin: Make sure you have Kotlin installed on your machine. You can download it from Kotlin's official website.
Set up an IDE: If you're not using a command-line interface, it's recommended to use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio for easier development.
Create a Kotlin file: In your IDE, create a new Kotlin file (e.g., Main.kt).
Copy the Code: Paste the Rock-Paper-Scissors game code into your Kotlin file.
Run the Program: Click on the "Run" button in your IDE or use the command line to execute the Kotlin file using:

Features:
Random Computer Move: The game generates a random choice for the computer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
User Input: The user can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Winner Determination: The game compares the userâ€™s input with the computer's move and determines the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Display Results: The game prints the computer's move, the user's move, and announces the winner.

Future Enhancements:
GUI Version: Convert the game into a graphical user interface (GUI) version using JavaFX or Kotlin's libraries, so players can interact with buttons instead of the console.
Score Tracking: Implement a feature that keeps track of the score throughout multiple rounds, so players can see their cumulative wins, losses, and ties.
Play Again Option: After each round, prompt the player if they want to play again, instead of exiting the program.
